# Python- Challenge
In this assignment I exercised my python skills through 2 projects : Py Bank and PyPoll
## PyBank
In the PyBank Challenge, I used for loops to look through fiancials records for analysis purposes. With this code I was able to record the folowing:
  
    - The total number of months included in the dataset

    - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
    
## PyPoll
PyPoll also required e to use for loops. This time I looped through election data in order to tally votes (in total and by candidate) as well as determine the election's winner
